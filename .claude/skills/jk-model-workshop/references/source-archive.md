# Source archive and offline research

When an original source disappears, use the confirmed snapshot below, the pinned
implementation reference in the [source index](evidence/source-archive-index.json),
or the locally included analysis and licensed code. The workshop download retains
the research. An archived page preserves a historical source; a newer engine or
tool still needs its own compatibility check.

The 30 September 2026 index covers **222 external source endpoints** from the research
library, recovery ledgers and credits, including pages and package downloads.
**28 Wayback pages have confirmed working replays:** the 25
previously checked pages plus three early TDIR project pages recovered through
their exact dated replay URLs. Those three were fetched and their content inspected;
they do not imply an availability-API check or a successful request to the original
site today. All 93 earlier source records and their historical observations remain
intact. Citation fragments share one page record while retaining each exact link.

Each record retains its source identity, purpose and available access or archive
evidence. An untested link stays marked untested. Thirty records carry a source pin;
the earlier verification of 28 distinct pin/maintained-alternative URLs remains
recorded separately. New raw-code receipts identify their actual retrieval endpoints
and do not certify that the corresponding GitHub HTML page was reachable. Pins
preserve a revision's identity while the host remains available; they are not
automatically local copies.

Discord message links have separate coverage and attribution ledgers and are
excluded from this public-endpoint inventory. The [recent-message ledger](evidence/community-discord-sources.json)
selects 18 sources from 300 saved messages in three channels, dated 26–30 September
2026. The [historical-method ledger](evidence/community-discord-model-methods.json)
selects 23 sources from a live server-wide reading of 472 message occurrences
(459 unique IDs), with visible dates spanning 2021–2026, plus three separately
reviewed TDIR messages. The [Mortal Kombat ledger](evidence/mortal-kombat-sources.json)
records a further Reiko lead and bounded search results. These overlapping
collections must not be added together as a deduplicated server-history total.
Their concise technical synthesis is included offline; no public Discord replay
or complete-server reading is claimed.

## What remains usable offline

| Need | Included material |
| --- | --- |
| Choose a modeling method without reopening a forum | [Methods and options](methods-and-options.md), [compatibility](compatibility.md), and [JKE/TDIR/Shred research](jke-tdir-shred-research.md) preserve the practical synthesis, attributed historical advice, identified input hashes and measured model examples |
| Recover detailed community methods and who taught them | [Community modeling](community-modeling-research.md) and [surface research](community-surface-research.md) retain attributed methods from 40 distinct forum discussions, eight tutorials and one news repost, with exact reading scope and source receipts |
| Evaluate recent weapon-hand and tool advice | [Discord research](community-discord-research.md) retains a bounded synthesis, author attribution and counterexamples; saved-message context does not establish completed runtime testing |
| Learn historical hierarchy, LOD, normals and animation methods | [Discord model methods](community-discord-model-methods.md) preserves Shred's practical methods and corrections, Stormtrooper's rigid-object animation workflow, Urgon's dated exporter status and SMLiberator's normal-format diagnosis |
| Distinguish TDIR's early plans, leaked build and later release | [TDIR beta research](tdir-beta-research.md) preserves contemporary identities, early character leads and actual 1.1 comparison evidence; the beta binary remains unlocated and unauthenticated |
| Recover historical Mortal Kombat model leads | [Mortal Kombat research](mortal-kombat-research.md) preserves three package identities, original/mirror hashes, measured model headers and the unresolved Cyrax/Sektor status; live mirrors are distinct from dated archival replays |
| Reconstruct texture/bake decisions | [Blender export and baking](blender-export-and-baking.md), [textures](textures-and-imagegen.md), and the [Terminator case study](terminator-case-study.md) preserve the recipe and what was actually checked |
| Understand local mesh generation and automation | [Partial generation](partial-generation.md) and [local generation automation](local-generation-automation.md), plus the selected source files below |
| Repeat a meaningful model test | [Testing methods](testing-methods.md), [runtime and packaging](runtime-and-packaging.md), and the bundled runtime-test-plan template |
| Inspect the implementation behind a technical claim | [Licensed source manifest](evidence/source-snapshots.json) and [source bundle guide](../assets/research-sources/README.md) |

The focused implementation bundle contains seven source files or source extracts
and three upstream license texts, totaling 190,496 bytes. It includes ComfyUI's
native Hunyuan nodes, GLB saver and server; trellis.cpp preprocessing and CLI; and
OpenJKDF2 KEY loading plus the studied texture-dimension function. Every entry has
an exact commit, origin, SHA-256, local path and retained license. The small renderer
function is explicitly an extract; it is not the complete graphics implementation.
These files are reading evidence, not standalone installed applications.

Upstream licenses continue to govern those copies. The workshop's MIT license does
not replace GPL or other component terms. The archive contains no commercial game
archives, community model artwork, full forum exports, videos, model weights or
private conversations.

## Short knowledge notes

These original notes preserve decisions that remain useful when a source is
temporarily unreachable. Detailed counts and test limits remain in the linked
research chapters; none of the notes turns a historical author observation into an
universal engine guarantee.

- **Shred18's practical mesh budget:** the August 2005 discussion treats roughly
  500 triangulated faces as an authoring limit and also recognizes a vertex limit.
  Count positions, UV entries and polygon records separately. Splitting for hard
  normals or seams can change export counts even when the visible silhouette does
  not change.
- **The July 2005 mesh-limit discussion:** contributors challenged an asserted
  total-mesh cap and supplied a larger working example. Do not substitute a forum
  recollection for an identified executable's per-mesh and animation constraints.
- **Ruthven's texture method:** several carefully painted 256-square 16-bit tiles
  can support detailed weapons. This offers a practical alternative to making one
  enormous atlas; allocation of useful UV space still matters.
- **The 2005 lighting discussion:** apparent full brightness prompted investigation
  of extra-light data, then a different lighting cause. Inspect the actual face,
  material and scene combination before removing shading from an entire model.
- **Quib Mask's later engine work:** dynamic node manipulation and lighting
  overrides belong to a documented modified-engine feature set. A model relying on
  them must declare that dependency instead of presenting the behavior as stock.
- **Sith format references:** a hierarchy node, a mesh record, a KEY allocation and
  a PUP gameplay role are different parts of the model contract. Keep mesh indices
  and parent/child indices consistent, preserve the intended animation-addressed
  slots, and validate roles such as aim/fire separately from geometric appearance.
- **TDIR and JKE:** the preserved research distinguishes a coordinated custom
  character/animation system from detailed familiar-rig construction. TDIR's
  alternative body branches need matching tracks; JKE's rigid detail children do
  not become cloth simulation. Release identity and supported installation matter.
- **Shred18's hierarchy and surface advice:** the additional discussions explain
  parent/pivot placement and retaining a familiar animation hierarchy, while his
  texture comments distinguish deliberate brush/bump work from an assumed noise
  filter. Preserve the author, post context and uncertainty instead of reducing the
  advice to an unattributed recipe.
- **Early TDIR roster evidence:** the archived project page advertises SSJ4 Goku,
  SSJ4 Vegeta, Super 13 and Super 17. Advertisement is not proof of inclusion in the
  leak. King Kai, King Vegeta, Mr. Popo and Tapion are present in the inspected 1.1
  assets and must not be mislabeled beta-only.
- **External weapon hands:** Shred's shared-resource explanation and the reported
  Repeater counterexample support offering separate options: retain the stock hand,
  conceal it in one character, replace shared assets, or add character-aware weapon
  integration. The saved discussion does not demonstrate a universal fix.
- **Blender's geometry interfaces:** evaluated geometry and source-mesh geometry
  are different inputs. Per-corner normals carry sharp/custom shading distinctions
  that a single averaged vertex normal loses. Bake/export a prepared copy and inspect
  the resulting vertex budget.
- **ComfyUI's protocol:** prompt acceptance supplies a job identifier, not proof of
  a completed mesh. Match per-job history and output descriptors, handle errors,
  and inspect the file before returning success. Pinned implementation snapshots
  preserve the corresponding node and saver contracts.
- **Wine, Xvfb and WSL:** a private graphical display can run an original executable
  without using the main desktop, while a null renderer cannot demonstrate texture
  appearance. Record the actual rendering backend. WSLg's visible GUI support is a
  different route from a private Xvfb test display.
- **Jon`C's Windows color-error diagnosis:** a conflicting application-compatibility
  database was implicated in a historical JK startup problem. The conditional
  removal command targets that exact custom database; it is not a reason to reduce
  textures to 256 colors or remove unrelated compatibility settings.
- **BodyParts3D and inherited art:** a donor's declared license and the final
  project's rights are separate checks. Preserve source attribution and applicable
  share-alike terms; a portfolio credit alone does not grant redistribution rights.

## Sources without a confirmed replay

The full index keeps unsuccessful or unattempted archive checks visible. The TDIR
Massassi landing page has no confirmed replay in this index, while the separately
identified TDIR 1.1 ModDB page does. The SDBINST command-page snapshot was listed by
the archive but its replay was unavailable during this check; it is not counted
among the confirmed pages. The Microsoft database-management page and original
Massassi discussion provide working archived companions.

The Blender baking link containing `/UATEST/` and the ChatGPT Projects page have no
confirmed snapshot here. Several original endpoints denied the automated request,
and some GitHub project links returned anonymous 404 despite maintained GitLab
alternatives. Those statuses do not prove that a project was deleted. Later archive
lookups were rate-limited; no archive-submission queue was treated as a saved page.
The expanded forum/tutorial sources retain attribution, original synthesis and
retrieval receipts while new availability lookups remain deferred. The three known
TDIR replays above are explicitly verified exceptions, not evidence that every new
source or its linked download has been archived.

For code, prefer a supplied commit pin, a verified maintained alternative, or the
licensed local snapshot. The index retains live release/tag links when no exact
commit was independently established. Media and game-asset download URLs remain
source references; they are not bundled or represented as preserved downloads.

If a source changes a conclusion, record the exact source revision and update the
analysis through the normal [research update/report process](updates-and-reporting.md).
Keep old source identity when it explains an earlier result. A new link or newer
archive should improve the evidence, not silently rewrite which release was studied.
